# 6. RISC-V Calling Convention
Now that we understand how RISC-V programs are made, let's see how we might use this knowledge to implement bigger projects using assembly code. To do this, we need to introduce a calling convention because functions that you implement may accidentally overwrite data in another function because registers are in the scope of all functions. How might we deal with that? Calling Convention is the answer
