# 3. Memory Safety Vulnerabilities
This note describes some memory safety vulnerabilities, namely buffer overflow vulnerabilities, stack smashing, string/integer vulnerabilities, off-by-one vulnerabiliites. 

## Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities
Buffer overflows are particularly a risk in C, and since C is a widely used systems programming lanugage, we must know how to protect against them. C++ and Objective-C also suffer from these vulnerabilities.

If a programmer declares an array `char buffer[4]`, C will not automatically throw an error if the programmer tries to access `buffer[5]`. The programmer's responsibility is to check that every memory access is in bounds. 

Let's start with the example

```
char buf[8];
void vulnerable() {
	gets(buf)
}
```

First, know the syntax:

- `gets()` reads as many bytes of input as the user supplies (through standard input), and stores them into `buf[]`. Even if the input contains more than 8 bytes of data, `gets()` will write past the end of `buf`, overwriting some other part of memory.

A danger that can appear:

```
char buf[8];
int authenticated = 0;
void vulnerable() {
    gets(buf);
}
```

note where the variables are stored in our memory model. They are located in static. Static grows upwards, so `authenticated` is right above `buf`. Let's therefore write 9 bytes of data to `buf` such that the `authenticated` flag is set to `true`. Now an attacker can gain access. 

Modify the code to look like this instead

```
char buf[8];
int (*fnptr)();
void vulnerable() {
    gets(buf);
}
```

Now that the static data is `fnptr`, note that this is a 4 byte value that stores the address of a function that weill dereference the pointer and start executing those instructions at the address. Therefore, let's `gets(buf)` with 12 bytes, where the ending 4 bytes point to an address of our choosing, redirecting program execution to some other memory location. Perhaps where malicious machine instructions are stored? This is a **malicious code injection** attack. 

- Malicious code injection attacks allow an attacker to seize control of the program. At the conclusion of the attack, the program is still running, but now it is executing code chosen by the attacker, rather than the original code. 

- For example, if a web server is running as root, once the attacker seizes control, the attacker can do anything that root can do; for example, leaving a backdoor that allows them to log in as root later. Now the system has been "owned" (also called pwned, 0wned, ownzored).

## Stack Smashing
We can also exploit stack variables

```
void vulnerable() {
	char buf[8];
	gets(buf);
}
```

Two things to note: above `buf` in the stack lies the return address and other things, like `rip` and `sfp`. We could possible overwrite them with some carefully chosen inputs. 

Let's assume malicious code exists at `0xDEADBEEF`. Then we just input `AAAAAAAAAAAA\xef\xbe\xad\xde`. And Boom! we have now just make the `rip` overwritten with `0xDEADBEEF`, and the program will go there once the function returns. The program now will start running code at that address. Note that since x86 is little-endian, we had to input it as above.

Now if the malicious code didn't already exist, what if we write some shellcode that allows us to perform arbitrary actions. If the shellcode was 8 bytes long. We might input something like 

`[shellcode] + [4 bytes of garbage] + [address of buf]`. 

Now notice that `rip` is sent to the shellcode. That is bad!

Now suppose the shellcode is 100 bytes long. Obviously the shellcode won't fit, but let's do this

`[12 bytes of garbage] + [address of rip + 4] + [shellcode]`

Now the shellcode is above the `rip` in memory, so then we start running code at the shellcode. since the `rip` is sent just above it.
