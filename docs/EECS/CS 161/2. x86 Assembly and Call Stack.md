# 2. x86 Assembly and Call Stack

## Number Representation

A nibble is 4 bits, a byte is 8 bits, and a word is 32 bits (on 32b architectures). The word is the size of a pointer. Real-world 64-bit architectures include stronger defenses against memory safety exploits. 

Take a look at [[1. Number Representation]] for information on how to represent numbers.

## Compiler, Assembler, Linker, Loader (CALL)

There are 4 main steps to running a C program:
1. Compiler: translates C code into assembly instructions. We will use x86 Assembly, where 61C uses RISC-V ISA
2. Assembler: Translates assembly instructions into machine code (raw bits). 
3. Linker: Resolves dependencies on external libraries. After the linker is finished linking external libraries, it outputs a binary executable of the program that you can run.
4. Loader: set up an address space in memory and runs the machine code instructions in the executable.

Learn more about CALL in detail in [[8. Compiler, Assembler, Linker, Loader (CALL)]] from 61C notes.

## C Memory Layout
We can draw the memory layout as one long array with $2^32$ elements, where each element is one byte. The leftmost element has address $0x00000000$ and the rightmost element is $0xFFFFFFFF$. We visually see this as a grid of bytes, where the bottom-left element is $0x00000000$ and the top-right element has $0xFFFFFFFF$.

We further separate the address space into four sections. From lowest to highest address, they are:
- Code: Contains the executable instructions of the program (the code itself). Here, the assembler and linker output raw bytes that are stored in the code section.

- Static: Contains constants and static variables that never change during program execution, and are usually allocated when the program is started

- Heap: Stores dynamically allocated data. We do this with `malloc` and `free` in C. The heap starts at lower addresses and grows up to higher addresses as more memory is allocated.

- Stack: Stores local variables and other information associated with function calls. The stack starts at higher addresses and grows down as more functions are called.

## Little-Endian Words
x86 is Little-Endian, meaning that when storing a word in memory, the least significant byte is stored at the lowest address, and the most significant byte is stored at the highest address. To store the word $0x44332211$, we stored them in bytes as

![[2.3 little-endian.png]]

You see that the least significant byte $0x11$ is stored at the lowest address, and the most significant bytes $0x44$ is stored at the highest address. 

## Registers
There are also registers, which store memory directly on the CPU. Each register can store one word. Registers do not have addresses, but we refer to registers using names. x86 has three special registers:

1. eip: instruction pointer, which stores the address of the machine instruction currently being executed. RISC-V equivalent: PC (program counter)
2. ebp: base pointer, which stores the address of the top of the current stack frame. RISC-V equivalent: FP (frame pointer)
3. esp: stack pointer, stores the address of the bottom of the current stack frame. RISC-V equivalent: SP (stack pointer)

The "e" in the register abbreviations stands for "extended" and indicates we are using a 32-bit system (extended from 16-bit system). 

Sometimes, the registers can point somewhere in memory. We can store the address of a pointer that goes to another part of memory. 

## Stack: Pushing and Popping
If we want to remember a value, we save it on the stack. We do the following 2-step procedure to add a value on a stack
1. Allocate additional space on the stack by decrementing the esp
2. Store the value in the newly allocated space

The x86 `push` instruction does both of these steps to add a value to the stack. 

![[2.4 push.png]]

When we pop a value off the stack, the value is not wiped away from memory. Instead `esp` is incremented tso that the popped value is now below `esp`. Since `esp` points to the bottom of the stack, the popped value below `esp` is now in undefined memory.

## x86 Colling Convention
Some syntactical differences between x86 syntax and RISC-V syntax:
1. destination register comes last in x86
2. references to registers are preceded with a percent sign. To reference `eax`, we would do `%eax`. 
3. immediates are preceded with a dollar sign (such as `$1`, `$0x4`).
4. Memory references use parenthesis and can have immediate offsets, such as `12(%esp)`, which dereferences memory 12 bytes above the address contained in `esp`. If parentheses are used without an immediate offset, the offset can be through of as an implicit `0`. 

Here is an example. The assembly instruction `xorl 4(%esi), $eax` will be interpreted as the following. Here, the opcode is `xorl`, the source is `4(%esi)`, and the destination is `%eax`. As such, the pseudocode might be written as `EAX = EAX ^ *(ESI + 4)`. We dereference the value 4 bytes above the address stored in `esi`. 

## x86 Function Calls
To call a function, the stack allocates extra space to store local variables and other information relevant to the function. Since the stack grows down, the extra space is at a lower address. Once the function returns, the space on the stack is freed up for future function calls. 

The **caller** calls the **callee**. Program execution starts in the caller, moves to the callee as a result of the function call, and then returns to the caller after the function call completes. 

In x86, we need to update the values in all three registers we've discussed:
1. `eip`, the instruction pointer needs to be changed to point to the instructions of the callee
2. `ebp` and `esp` need to be updated to point to the top and bottom of a new stack frame for the callee

There are 11 steps to call an x86 function and returning. 
1. Push arguments onto the stack. Since `esp` gets decremented as we push arguments onto the stack, we should push arguments in reverse order.
2. Push the old `eip` (rip) on the stack. `rip` is the (return instruction pointer). 
3. Move `eip` to point to the instructions for the callee function
4. Push the old `ebp` (called `sfp`) on the stack. This is the saved frame pointer. We do this since we are about to change the value in the `ebp` register. 
5. Move `ebp` down. We can safely change `ebp` to point to the top of the new stack frame. The top of the new stack frame is where `esp` is currently pointing, since we are about to allocate new space below `esp` for the new stack frame.
6. Move `esp` down. We allocate new space for the new stack frame by decrementing `esp`. The compiler looks at the function to determine how far `esp` should be decremented. 
7. Execute the function. Arguments will be located starting at the address stored in `ebp` plus 8
8. Move `esp` up. When the function is ready to return, increment `esp` to point to the top of the stack frame (`ebp`). This effectively erases the stack frame. 
9. Restore the old `ebp` (called `sfp`). 
10. Restore the old `eip` (called `rip`)
11. Remove arguments from the stack by incrementing the `esp`

## x86 Function Call in Assembly
Let's play the role of the compiler:

```
int main(void) {
	foo(1, 2)
}

void foo(int a, int b) {
	int bar[4];
}
```

The compiler would turn the `foo` functioninto the following x86:

```
main:
    # Step 1. Push arguments on the stack in reverse order
    push $2
    push $1

    # Steps 2-3. Save old eip (rip) on the stack and change eip
    call foo

    # Execution changes to foo now. After returning from foo:

    # Step 11: Remove arguments from stack
    add $8, %esp

foo:
    # Step 4. Push old ebp (sfp) on the stack
    push %ebp

    # Step 5. Move ebp down to esp
    mov %esp, %ebp

    # Step 6. Move esp down
    sub $16, %esp

    # Step 7. Execute the function (omitted here)

    # Step 8. Move esp
    mov %ebp, %esp

    # Step 9. Restore old ebp (sfp)
    pop %ebp

    # Step 10. Restore old eip (rip)
    pop %eip
```

Steps 1-3 happens in the caller function. Step 3 changes the `eip` to point to the callee. Once `eip` is changed, steps 4-10 happen in the calee function. Step 10 changes the `eip` to point back to the caller. And then now step 11 takes place.

We use shorthand to write function returns. Step 8 and 9 are abbreviated as the `leave` instruction, and step 10 is abbreviated as the `ret` instruction. Maybe we can just write `leave ret` after each function

We call steps 4-6 the function prologue, and steps 8-10 the function epilogue.
