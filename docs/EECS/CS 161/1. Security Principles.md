# 1. Security Principles
This note describes the basic security principles one should consider when implementing anything computer security related.

## Know Your Threat Model
Threat mode: model of who your attacker is and what resources they have. 

Here are some commone assumptions we take into account for attackers:

1. Attacker can interact with your systems without anyone noticine, meaning you might not always be able to detect the attacker tampering with your system before they attack
2. Attacker has general information about your system, such as the OS, any potential software vulnerabilities, etc.
3. Attacker is persistent and lucky; for example any vulnerability left to chance should be assumed to work for the attacker
4. Attacker has resources required to undertake the attack (such as computation power, money, etc.)
5. Attacker can coordinate several complex attacks across various systems, so they can attack your entire network at the same time
6. Every system is a potential target. For example, a casino was once hacked because a fish-tank thermometer was hacked within the network.

Also consider old code where the threat model might have changed. The Internet was mostly populated by academics who trusted one another. Now there are billions of devices, some of them are malicious.

## Consider Human Factors
There are also other non-coding related factors to consider

1. Programmers themselves mighjt make mistakes and use tools that allow them to make mistakes
2. Users like convenience, so if a security system is unusable and not user-friendly, no matter how secure it is, it will go unused
3. Social engineering attacks are when one exploits other's trust and access for personal gain

## Security is Economics
Sometimes more security means more costs, more money. But also sometimes one needs to consider the relation between the expected benefit of defense and the expected cost of the attack (such as putting a $100 lock on a $1 item). 

A corollary of this principle is that you should focus your energy on securing the weakest links. A system is only as secure as the weakest link. Attackers follow the path of least resistance, and they will attack the system at its weakest point. 

A related principle is conservative design, which states that systems should be evaluated according to the worst security failure that is at all plausible, under assumptions favorable to the attacker. 

## Detect If You Can't Prevent
Detection is simply learning tha the attack has taken place, and response would be doing something about the attack. When dealing with a response, you should always assume bad things will happen, and therefore prepare your systems for the worst case outcome. You should plan security in a way that lets you get back to some form of a working state a (like keeping offsite backups of computer systems).
