# 7. RISC-V Instruction Formats
Let's get one level lower and actually now get into the bits being the instructions. We won't be programming in bits, though, just see how to translate the main types of instructions: arithmetic, branching, jumps, calls to other functions. One reason why we need to understand this is when we get another level lower and talk about logic gates, where it will culminate into wiring up a CPU to handle all the RISC-V instructions. 

Get back to [[toc CS61C]].

### Overview of Section
We will talk about these items:

- [[7.1 Anatomy of a RISC-V instruction]]

- [[7.2 R and I Types]]

- [[7.3 B and S Types]]

- [[7.4 J and U Types]]

- [[7.5 Self-Modifying Code]]
