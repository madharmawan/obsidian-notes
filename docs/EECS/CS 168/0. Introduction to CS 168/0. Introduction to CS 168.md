# 0. Introduction
The purpose of these notes is to go through the content of computer networking and architecture, based on the material from the textbook, Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach by Kurose and Ross. I plan to make a set of comprehensive notes out of these notes, so I would like to think of this as a rough draft of it. I also will draw notes from the class CS 168 Introduction to the Internet: Architecture and Protocols, taken at UC Berkeley and taught by Professor Sylvia Ratnasamy. Primarily these notes will be meant for this class, and will possibly be made for future students taking this class.

Personally, I have no experience in this subject, but through these notes, I hope I can get proficient in the jargon and concepts well enough. The plan is to follow with the concepts of lecture, drawing from the textbook for more detailed information.
