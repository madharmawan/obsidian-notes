# 3. Control
Now it is time to introduce ways of controlling our programs, rather than just sequential, line-by-line, reading of your code. Control allows us to implement functions that depend on values passed in. A consequence of this is that the problems we will face will become more difficult, so I will be sure to indicate problem-solving strategies that are critical to solving these problems.

Sections that will be covered:

[[3.1 If, Elif, Else Clauses]]
[[3.2 ]]
