# 4. Higher Order Functions I
These next 3 chapters: [[4. Higher Order Functions I]], [[5. Environment Diagrams]], and [[6. Higher-Order Functions II]] can be seen as the next section, but I decided to break it up into the first part being conceptual, the second part being visual, and the third part being applicable. Higher Order Functions allow you to make your programs more general -- who needs an `add_2` function, when we could have an `operator_n` function? I could write a summation function, but I can also write a product function -- what if I wrote one function that encapsualtes both?

The following will be covered in this chapter:

[[4.1 Functions as Parameters, Functions as Returns]]

[[4.2 Lambda Functions]]
