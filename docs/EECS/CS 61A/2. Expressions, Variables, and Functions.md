# 2. Expressions, Variables, and Functions
At this point, you probably think programming is as good as a calculator; you can add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc. But it is more than that. This chapter focuses on seeing programs as more than just a fancy calculator, seeing how we can manipulate values stored in variables, and create functions that can operate on parameters and return a value based on some procedure. Then later, we will use the results from [[3. Control]] to create even more complex functions, and then the rest of these set of notes is about creating functions that solves problems.

Here are the topics we will cover:
