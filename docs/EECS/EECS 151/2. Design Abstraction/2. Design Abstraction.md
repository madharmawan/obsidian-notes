# 2. Design Abstraction

## Review
- Moore's law is slowing down. There are continued improvements in technology, but at a slower pace

- Dennard's scaling ended a decade ago. All designs are now power limited

- Specialization and customization provides added performance. Under power constraints and stagnant technology

- Design costs are high. Methodology and better reuse to the rescue!

## Design Abstraction

![[2.1 Apple A12.png]]

Design abstractions: design through layers of abstraction, each part works separately

![[2.2 Abstraction.png]]

1. Specification: What goals do we have? What parts do we need to make. How do we plan it to work. Functionality? Why we want to do this?
2. Model: Early stage tool to approach the design. Before we design in Verilog, we see if we can understand the hardware in some model like C.
3. Architecture: Where we actually describe what hardware we want to use. How are the different components connected? Details, separation into modules. We will look at the RISC-V 32b architecture
4. RTL Logic Design: implementation of hardware. Writing RTL into modules. Describing hardware through HDL. We will use Verilog (briefly talk about Chisel)
5. Physical Design: Using tools to get the final design.

EECS 251B: Spring semester - Added lecture on SystemVerilog. Interested in expanding it into a full lab.

### Example: RISC-V Design Process
Specification: https://riscv.org/specifications/

Model: https://riscv.org/software-statue/#simulators

Architecture: https://www.lowrisc.org/docs/tagged-memory-v0.1/rocket-core/ + CS 152

RTL Logic Design: https://riscv.org/risc-v-cores/

Physical Design: ASIC or FPGA

Manufactured Part: https://www.sifive.com/boards/higfive-unleashed

EECS 151 will focus on Architecture, RTL Logic Design, and Physical Design.

### RTL --> Physical Design
The labs will focus on a process of translating RTL to physical ASIC or FPGA by using industry-standard tools. It eplores the entire design stack

Tapeout class gets to the fabrication part of the abstraction.

## Implementing Digital Systems With Logic Gates
Digital systems implement a set of Boolean equations.

The logic gates are discussed more in detail in [[9. Combinatorial Logic, Boolean Algebra]].

![[2.4 logic.png]]

CMOS gates are always inverting. 

![[2.5 logic2.png]]

CMOS is a state of art mechanism. We will talk about the semiconductor industry and see why CMOS is important in fabrication for the smiconductor industry

### Combinational Logic

Output a function only of the current inputs. Truth-table representation of function. Output is explicitly specified for each input combination. In general, CL blocks have more than one output signal, in which case, the truth-table will have multiple output columns.

For example, a two bit adder:

![[2.8 adder.png]]

Slashes mean it is a group of wires but shown as one with simplicitly. We label the number of bits. The result is three wires. 

The total number of possible truth tables with 4 inputs and 1 output is what?

$2^{2^4} = 65536$. In general, a $n$ input, 1 output scenario has $2^{2^n}$. 4 inputs which means there are $2^4 = 16$ rows. However, each output can be 0 or 1 for each of those $16$, Then we get $2^16 = 65536$. 

For $m$ outputs, it might be what?

### Sequential Logic
Output is a function of both the current input and the state. State represents the memory. State is a function of previous inputs. In synchronous digital systems, state is updated on each clock tick. 

![[2.9 sequential.png]]

We might do a sequential adder design rather than a combinational one, where the state that is remembered is the carry bit.

Example: Flip-Flop

- Synchronous state element transfers its input to the output on a rising clock edge. 

![[2.10 flipflop.png]]

A sequence of flip-flops is a register. In 61C, we used registers which were 32 flip-flops. 

## Register Transfer Level Abstraction (RTL)
Any synchronous digital circuit can be represented with all of the following:

- Combination Logic Blocks

- State Elements (registers or memories)

- Clock orchestrates sequencing of CL operations

![[2.11 sds.png]]

Verilog is designed to describe synchronous digital circuits. We will use it to describe any combinational and sequential logic. 

## Summary
The design proces involves traversing layers of specification, modeling, architecture, RTL design, and physical implementation. Digital systems implement a set of Boolean equations.
