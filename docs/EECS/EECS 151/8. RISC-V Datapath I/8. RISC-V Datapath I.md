# 9. RISC-V Datapath I

## Stages of Datapath

A single CL block that executes an instruction is too bulky and inefficient. The solution is to break up the process of executing an instruction into stages, and then connect the stages to create the whole datapath. There are 5 stages of the datapath:
1. Instruction Fetch (IF)
2. Instruction Decode (ID)
3. Execute (EX)
4. Memory Access (MEM)
5. Write Back to Register (WB)

## State and Sequencing


Memory: One input bus: data in. One output bus: data out

1. Memory word is found by:

- Read: address selects the word to put on data out

- Write: set write enable = 1. Address selects the memory word to be written via the data in bus

2. Clock

- Only a factor during write operation

- During read operation, behaves as a combinational logic block: address valid --> data out valid after "access time"

## RISC-V Datapath & Control
Every instruction is 32-bits divided into fields of varying numbers each. 

- opcode: specifies what instruction it is

- May have funct7 & funct3: fields describe what operation to perform. 

### R-Format Instruction Layout

![[8.1 rtype.png]]

- rs1, rs2, rd: three registers that can be expressed in 5 bits. The instruction will operate on `rs1`, `rs2` and store its result in `rd`. 

$$ \text{<instr> rd, rs1, rs2} $$
R-type instructions usually makes two changes to machine's state. 
1. Modify the `rd` register with the inputs `rs1`, `rs2`. Done in the ALU.
2. `PC = PC + 4`. 

![[8.2 dataadd.png]]

Here is also a timing diagram for `add`. 

![[8.3 timeadd.png]]

- Increment the `PC` to get ready for next instruction asynchronously

- Read the instruction asynchronously

- We read the registers asynchronously

- Then it goes into ALU and after some combinational delay it is ready

- Now perform the write operation, which is a synchronous write. See how `reg[1]` matches the rising edge of `clk`. 

Here are some more R-Type instructions

![[8.4 otherrtype.png]]

- Notice how decoding the `funct3` and `funct7` fields tell us which ALU function we want. 


### I-Format Instruction Layout
Only one field is different from R-format, `rs2` and `func7` replaced by a 12-bit signed immediate, `imm[11:0]`. 

![[8.5 itype.png]]

Here are the I-format instructions

![[8.6 itypeinstr.png]]

- Not operation is not in the ISA, but `xori` can do this. `xori rd, rs1, -1`. 

- The shift operations. They only use the lower 5 bits of the immediate value for shift amount (because 5 bits can already shift out the 0-31 bits positions)

- The same `Inst[30]` immediate bit is used to distinguish "shift right logical" from "shift right arithmetic"

An `addi` instruction datapath might look like

![[8.7 addidata.png]]

This also supports R-type instructions. Just alter the image so that the ALUSel can pick out all the operations as needed. 

Load instructions are also I-type. 

![[8.8 loadinstr.png]]

Its form is generally `Reg[rd] = Mem[Reg[rs1] + offset]`

- The 12-bit signed immediate is added to the base address in register `rs1` to form the memory address

- The value loaded from memory is stored in register `rd`. 

In our DMEM block we need to add some datapath to support `lw`. 

![[8.9 lwdata.png]]

- See that there is a WBSel control logic that will perform memory operations that support `lw`. 

There are also other load instructions

![[8.10 loadinstrs.png]]

- `lbu`: load unsigned byte; `lh`: load halfword (word = 32 bits)

- Supporting the narrower loads requires additional logic to extract the correct byte/halfword from the value loaded from memory, and sign or zero extend the result to 32 bits

### S-Format Instruction Layout

![[8.11 stype.png]]

- General format `Mem[Reg[rs1] + offset] = Reg[rs2]`

- Store needs to read two registers, `rs1` for base memory address, and `rs2` for data to be stored, as well as immediate offset

- Note stores don't write value to register file

- Immediates broken into two parts

- Can't have both `rs2` and immediate in same place as other instructions

- RISC-V design decision is move low 5 bits of immediate to where `rd` field was in other instructions. We can then keep `rs1` and `rs2` in the same place. The register names are more critical than immediate bits in hardware design

To store in in our datapath, we have some place to create some store in our DMEM

![[8.12 storedata.png]]

Here are all the store instructions:

![[8.13 sinstrs.png]]

Note that both I and S type use some immediate. 

![[8.14 immgenis.png]]

- Just need a 5-bit mux to select between two positions where low five bits of immediate can reside in instruction

- Other bits in immediate are wired to fixed positions in instruction. 


### B-Format Instruction Layout

![[8.15 btype.png]]

`<Branch Op> rs1, rs2, label`

- Branches read two registers but don't write a register. `PC` is being changed on branch. Now we need to represent labels and now instruction offsets.

- B-format is similar to S-format, with two register sources and a 12-bit immediate

- The 12 immediate bits encode 13-bit signed byte offsets. Notice how it is broken in to segments, but also they are not in order. It is to maintain consistency.

- The immediate represents values $\in\left[-2^{12}, 2^{12}\right]$ in two byte increments See how the` imm[0]` is not represented -- it is always `0`. We can always ignore the LSb since every instruction is 4 bytes. We actually could skip the 2 LSb's, but we don't because there are 16-bit instructions. This is the compressed extension, where instructions are 16 bits. To support compressed formats, we need the `imm[1]`. 

- The immediate generator would look like this for each I, S, B instruction

![[8.18 immgeneration.png]]

- To change this in our datapath, we need to tap into the PC counter and add some immediate to it. Running the branch instruction changes the state as follows:
1. `PC = PC + 4` branch not taken
2. `PC = PC + imm` branch taken

![[8.16 bdata.png]]

- The branch comparator only outputs two things in the control logic. $BrEq = 1$ if $A = B$, $BrLT = 1$ if $A < B$

- The input is either finding a signed or unsigned comparison, and $BrUN = 1$ if it is unsigned. 

- From this all branch instructions are possible, for example `A >= B` is simply the result of `not (A < B)`. 

- `PCSel` will tell if the branch is taken or not taken, and then add the appropriate value (`4` or the `imm`).

- There is also an input to the Immediate Generator to indicate how to generate the immediate correctly.

- ALU really determines the target instruction.

![[8.17 binstrs.png]]

### J-Format Instruction Layout
We don't do a comparison, we just jump there. 

First, let's look at a kinda J-type instruction: `jalr`

![[8.19 jtype.png]]

It is really an I-type instruction. 

`jalr rd, rs, imm`

- `R[rd] = PC + 4; RC = Reg[rs1] + imm`: writes `PC + 4` to `rd` and sets `PC = rs1 + imm`. 

- Uses same immediates as arithmetic and loads. No multiplication by 2 bytes, which is in contrast to branches and jal. 

Here is the addition of the datapath with `jalr`

![[8.20 jalr.png]]

- Note how the WBSel control has to have another option to simply have a choice to add 4 to PC.

Now here is a regular J-format instruction

![[8.21 jtypereal.png]]

For `jal` we apply the rule of

- `R[rd] = PC + 4; PC = PC + imm`

- This saves `PC + 4` in register `rd`

- Then set `PC = PC + offset`. 

- The target is somewhere within $\pm 2^{19}$ locations, with 2 bytes apart (20 bit is sign). Immediate encoding is optimized similarly to branch instruction to reduce hardware cost. 

There is a `j` pseudo instruction, which uses `jal` but sets `rd = x0` to discard return address. 

Here is datapath with `jal`

![[8.22 jal.png]]

- Notice the Immediate Generator must know how to create J immediates

### U-Format Instruction Layout

![[8.23 utype.png]]

- The U-format has a 20-bit immediate in upper 20 bits of 32-bit instruction word. 

- There is one destination register

- Used for two instructions:
1. `lui`: load upper immediate: `reg[rd] = {imm, 12b'0}`
2. `auipc`: add upper immediate to `PC`: `reg[rd] = PC + {imm, 12'b0}`

To implement `lui` and `auipc` we can just adjust the ImmSel to indicate we want U immediates.

## Summary
Implementation of the base ISA for RV32I

Instruction types: R, I, S, B, J, U types. Here are the formats in a summary

Implementation is straightforward, but single-cycle is slow --> pipeline it.
