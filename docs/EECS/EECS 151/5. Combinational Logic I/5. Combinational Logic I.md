# 5. Combinational Logic

## Introduction
In combinational logic, the outputs depend only on the current vlaues of the inputs. It is memoryless: compute the output values using the current inputs. If we change X, then Y will change immediately (or almost). There might be delay in the combinational unit used. 

We can represent combinational logic in 3 main ways: Boolean Equations, Truth Tables, Gate Representations. Knowing how to translate among all three are important skills.

## Boolean Algebra

### Fundamentals
There are two elements in our set $\{0, 1\}$. Then we want to use two binary operators and one unary operator (and, or, not). 

Given two variables $(x, y)$, there are 16 different ways to spit out an output of these inputs. Some of them are of interest, like NOR, NAND, XOR, XNOR.

Now, when we have $n$ inputs, we would need $2^n$ rows in our truth table. 

### Decomposition in Digital Design
We can construct an adder circuit by its truth table. Since there are carrying bits, we need a 3 input truth table with 2 functions that act on the three inputs.

### Laws of Boolean Algebra

$$
\begin{align*}
	\text{Identity:} && X + 0 = X, X * 1 + X\\
	&& X + 1 = 1, X * 0 = 0\\\\
	\text{Idempotence:} && X + X = X, XX = X\\\\
	\text{Complements:} &&X + X' = 1, XX' = 0\\\\
	\text{Commutative:} &&X + Y = Y + X, XY = YX\\\\
	\text{Associative:} &&(X + Y) + Z = X + (Y + Z)\\
	&& (XY)Z = X(YZ)\\\\
	\text{Distributive:} &&X(Y + Z) = XY + XZ\\
	&&X + (YZ) = (X + Y)(X + Z)\\\\
	\text{Absorptive:}&& X + XY = X(1 +Y) = X\\
	&&X(X + Y) = (X + 0)(X + Y)= X + (0Y) = X\\\\
\end{align*}
$$

More Laws:

$$
\text{DeMorgan's Law:} \qquad (xy)' = x' + y', (x + y)' = x'y'
$$

DeMorgan's law is powerful in digital design:
1. A NAND gate is equivalent to an OR gate with inverted inputs
2. A NOR gate is equivalent to an AND gate with inverted inputs
3. Bubble pushing: pusing a bubble from input through the gates. The bubble comes out in the output, and the gate flips from AND to OR or vice versa. 

### Canonical Forms
There are two types of canonical forms: 
1. Sum of Products (SOP)
2. Product of Sums (POS)

Sum of Products is also known as disjunctive normal form with minterm expansion. A minterm is a product (AND) involving all the inputs for the term to be 1. SOP is summing the minterms for which the output is True. We did this in CS 61C

Product of Sums is also known as conjunctive normal form with maxterm expansion. A maxterm is a sum (OR) involving all inputs for the term to be 0. POS is the product of maxterms for which the output is False. Can also obtain POSs from applying DeMorgan's law to the SOPs of F (and vice versa).

Canonical Forms are usually not minimal, so we will have to use boolean algebra to simplify them.

## Summary
Combinational circuits:

- The outputs only depend on the current values of the inputs (memoryless)

- The functional specification of a combinational circuit can be expressed as a truth table or boolean equation

Boolean Algebra:

- Deal with variables that are either True or False

- Map naturally to hardware logic gates

- Use theorems of Boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps to simplify equations
