# 4. Verilog II

## Review

Design metrics:
1. Functionality and robustness
2. Cost
3. Performance
4. Power and Energy

Verilog:
1. Hardware Description language
2. Logic synthesis: Verilog -> Gate-level netlists
3. Used in both ASIC and FPGA

## Verilog Introduction
A module definition describes a component in a circuit. There are two ways to describe module contents
1. Structural Verilog

- List of sub-components and how they are connected

- Just like schematics, but using text

- Tedious to write, hard to decode

- You get precise control over circuit details

- May be necessary to map to special resources of the FPGA/ASIC

2. Behavioral Verilog

- Describe what a component does, not how it does it

- Synthesized into a circuit that has this behavior

- Result is only as good as the tools

The idea is to build up a hierarchy of modules. Top-level module is your entire design (or the environment to test your design)

## Verilog Modules and Instantiation
Modules define circuit components. Instantiation defines hierarchy of design:

A module is not a functio in the C sense. Ther eis no call and return mechanism. Think of it more like a hierarchical data structure.

Here is an example: XOR

![[4.2 xor model.png]]

Note that the instantiated gates are not executed. They are active always. The xorgate already exists as a built-in (so really no need to define it). Undeclared variables assumed to be wires. Don't let this happen to you!

### Simple Behavioral Model

![[4.3 simplebehavioralmodel.png]]

The assign statement has a bitwise "and" gate. The assignment continuously happens, therefore any change on the RHS is reflected in `out` immediately (except for small delay associated with the implemnetaion of the practical `&`.)

It is not like an assignment in C that takes place when the program counter gets to that place in the program.

### Instantiation, Signal Array, Named Ports

## Continuous Assignment Examples
Assign values whenever there is a change in the RHS. Model combinational logic without specifying an interconnection of gates:

## Non-Continuous Assignmnets
This is a bit unusual from a hardware specification point of view. However it shows that Verilog is a simulation language

![[4.7 noncontinuous.png]]

## Always Blocks
Always blocks give us some constructs that are impossible or awkward in continuous assignments

![[4.9 muxif.png]]

## Simplified Verilog Guidelines
For combinational logic:
- Continuous assignment: `assign a = b & c`

- Always block with `@(*)`: 

```
always @(*) begin
	a = b & c; // blocking statement
end
```
