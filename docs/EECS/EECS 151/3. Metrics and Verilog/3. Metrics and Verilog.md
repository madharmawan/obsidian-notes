# 3. Metrics and Verilog
This notes explains how we evaluate systems and use Verilog

## Review

From [[2. Design Abstraction]]:

- The design process involves travresing the layers of specification, modeling, architecture, RTL design, and physical implementation

- Digital systems implement a set of Boolean equations

## Metrics
The desired functionality can be implemented with different performance, power, or cost targets. We want to measure it across these three dimensions, where we need to consider our goals to figure out which dimension to focus on.

- Power is important to find ways to make it efficient; carbon footprint considerations; reducing energy in fabrication and usage (low power = phone)

- Performance is important is a key dimension that a lot of people look at = (high performance = Google TPU)

- Cost includes design, verification, implementation costs. How can we use a current budget to produce something marketable (low cost  = watch, calculator)

### Cost
Non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs

- Fixed, one-time cost to research, design, and verify a new piece of HW

- Amortized over all units shipped. For example, $20M in development adds $0.20 to each of 100M units

Recurring costs

- Cost to manufacture, test and package a unit

- Processed wafer cost is about 10k (around 16nm node) which yields: 1 Cerebras chip, 50-100 large FPGAs or GPUs, 200 laptop CPUs, > 1000 cell phone SoCs

Some useful equations for fabrication

$$
\text{cost per IC} = \text{variable cost per IC} + \frac{\text{fixed cost}}{\text{volume}}
$$

where

$$
\text{variable cost} = \frac{\text{cost of die + cost of die test + cost of packaging}}{\text{final test yield}}
$$

Die Yield equations

$$
\text{die cost} = \frac{\text{wafer cost}}{\text{dies per wafer}\times\text{die yield}}
$$

where

$$
\text{die yield} = \frac{\text{number of good chips per wafer}}{\text{total number of chips per wafer}}\times 100\%
$$

### Performance
Throughput

- Number of tasks performed in a unit of time (operations per second)

- Watch out for "op" definitions -- can be a 1-b ADD or a double-precision FP add (or more complex task)

- Peak vs. average throughput

Latency

- How does a task take from start to finish

- E.g. facial recognition on a phone takes 10's of ms

- Sometime expressed in terms of clock cycles

- Average vs. "tail" latency

Digital Logic Delay: 

- Changes at the inputs do no instantaneously appear at the outputs. There are finite resistances and capacitances in each gate. 

- Propagation delay $t_p$ of a logic gate defines how quickly its output responds to a change at its inputs. Defined as 50% transition oints of the input and output waveforms. There is high-to-low and lot-to-high transitions

- Rise and fall times $t_r, t_f$ are for individual signals. Measures how fast a signal transmits

Digital Logic Timing:

- The longest propagation delay through CL blocks sets the maximum achievable clock frequency. You also need to consider the register in this calculation

- To increase the clock rate, you need to find the longest path and make it faster.

### Power and Energy
Energy in Joules

- Needed to perform a task

- Add two numbers or fetch a datum from memory

- Active and standby

- Battery stores certain amount of energy

- This is what ultility charges for

Power in Watts

- Energy dissipated in time

- Peak power vs. average power

- Sets cooling requirements

## Beneath Digital Abstraction

Beneath the digital abstraction includes 

- Logic gates; interpret inputs as 0s and 1s

- Noise: unwanted variations of voltages and currents in digital circuits

- Logic levels: mapping a continuous voltage onto a discrete binary logic variable. Low (0):  $[0, V_l]$, High (1): $[V_H, V_{DD}]$, where $V_L, V_H$ are nominal voltage levels

![[3.1 logiclevels.png]]

### Noise Margins

- Measure of the sensitivity of  gat to noise

- Represent the levels of noise that can be sustained when gates are cascaded

- The amount of noise that could be added to a worst-case output so that the signal can still be interpreted correctly as a valid input

![[3.2 noisemargins.png]]

### Voltage Transfer Characteristic

- Describes the output voltage as a function of the input voltage

- To choose logic levels -> slope = -1 -> maximize noise margin

![[3.3 vtc.png]]

### Regenerative Property

- Ensures that a disturbed signal gradually converges back to one of the nonminal voltage levels after passing through a number of logical stages

- Look for a sharp transition in voltage transfer characteristics

![[3.4 regenerative.png]]

- CMOS has a regenerative property.

## Verilog

### Hardware Description Languages

Verilog

- Simple C-like syntax for structural and behavior hardware constructs

- Mature set of commercial tools for synthesis and simulation

- Used in EECS 151

VHDL

- Semantically very close to Verilog

- More syntactic overhead

- Extensive type system for "synthesis time" checking

System Verilog

- Enhances Verilog with strong typing along with other additions

BlueSpec:

- Invended by Prof. Arvind at MIT

- Originally built within the Haskell programming language

- Now available commercially: bluespec.edu

Chisel

- Developed at UC Berkeley

- Used in CS 152, 250

- Available at: chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu

### Verilog: Brief History
Verilog was originated at Automated Integrated Design Systems (renamed Gateway) in 1985. It was acquired by Cadence in 1989.

It was invented as simulation language. Synthesis was an afterthought. Many of the basic techniques for synthesis were developed at Berkeley in the 80s and applied commercially in the 90s.

Around the same time as the origin of Verilog, US Department of Defense developed VHDL (VSIC (Very High-Speed Integraded Circuit) HDL). Because it was in public domain, it grew in popularity. Cadence opened Verilog to the public in 1990, afriad of losing market share.

Verilog is the language of choice of Silicon Valley companies, initially because of high-quality tool support and its similarity to C-language syntax


VHDL is still popular in government, Europe, Japan, some universities

Most major CAD frameworks now support both.

### Logic Synthesis
Verilog and VHDL started out as simulation languages but soon programs were written to automatically convert Verilog into low-level circuit descriptions (netlists)

Synthesis converts Verilog or other HDL descriptions to an implementation using technology-specific primitives. For FPGA, LUTs, FlipFlops, and BRAMs. For ASICs, standard cells and memory macros

### Verilog Introduction
A module definition describes a component in a circuit. There are two ways to describe module contents:
1. Structural Verilog: list of sub-components and how they are connected. Just like a schematic with text, tedious to write, hard to decode, but you get precise control over circuit details
2. Behavioral Verilog: describe what a component doees, not how it does it. Synthesized into a circuit that has this behavior. Result is only as good as the tools

Modules define circuit components. Instantiation defines hierarchy of design.
