# 6. Combinational Logic II and FSM I

## Boolean Simplification

### Why Logic Simplification?
We do logic simplificationbecause we want to minimize the number of gates in a circuit. Gates take area, and wasting area with more gates than usual is bad. Also we want to minimize the amount of wiring in the circuit. Wiring also takes space and is difficult to route. Physical gates have limited number of inputs. 

### Practical Methods for Boolean Simplification
The Uniting Theorem:

$$
xy' + xy = x(y' + y) = x(1) = x
$$

## Karnaugh Map Method
After working through several minimizations of Boolean quations using Boolean algebra, you realize that you sometimes end up with a completely different equation instead of a simplified quation. Karnaugh maps are a graphical method for simplifying Boolean equations. 

There is a method to represent the truth table and to help visualize the adjacencies. Here is the process:
1. Draw K-map of the appropriate number of variables
2. Fill in map with function values from truth table
3. Form groups of 1's. 

- Dimensions of groups must be even powers of two (1x1, 1x2, 1x4, ... , 2x2, 2x4, ...)

- Form as large as possible groups and as few as groups possible

- Groups can overlap (this helps make larger groups)

- Remember K-map is periodical in all dimensions (groups can cross over edges of map and continue on other side)

4. For each group write a product term

- The term includes the constant variables (use the uncomplemented variable for a constant 1 and complemented variable for constant 0)

6. Form Boolean expression as sum-of-products

Each circle on the K-map represents an implicant. The largest possible circles are prime implicants. Rules for finding a minimized equation from a K-map are:
1. Use the fewest circles to cover all the 1s
2. All the squares in each circle must contain 1's
3. Each circle must span a rectangular block that is a power of 2 in each direction
4. Each circle should be as large as possible
5. A circle may wrap around the edges of the K-mmap
6. A 1 in a K-map may be circled miultiple times if doing so allows fewer circles to be used. 

There are such things as higher-dimensional K-maps, but they are harder to draw out. 

There is also a POS version, where you form groups of 0's instead of 1's, and for each group write a sum term.
