This note explains Fourier series and the Fourier transform in both discrete and continuous forms, and also explains why this is important in quantum mechanics. 

## Review of Discrete and Continuous Fourier $\Sigma$ and $\int$ 

Discrete: consider $f(x)$ in interval $x\in[-\pi, \pi]$ that is periodic $f(x  +2\pi)  = f(x). Then

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}A_0 + \sum_{n =1}^{\infty}\left[A_n\cos(nx) + B_n\sin(nx)\right]
$$

The series will converge if $f(x), f'(x)$ are piecewise continuous on $(-\pi, \pi)$. In addition, $A_n, B_n$ are found by multiplying by basis $\sin(mx)$

$$
A_m = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)\cos(mx)dx
$$

$$
B_m = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\sin(mx)dx
$$

It can also be written in exponential form:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} c_ne^{inx}
$$

where

$$
c_m = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) e^{-imx}dx
$$

A useful quantity to know also is the Kronecker delta:

$$
\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}e^{i(n-m)}dx = \delta_{mn} = \begin{cases}1\qquad m = n\\0\qquad m\neq n\end{cases}
$$

which just show the dot product of two basis vectors are orthonormal.

In the continuous Forier transform, we find

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(k)e^{ikx}dk
$$

$$
g(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)e^{-ikx}dx
$$

Which is saying that you can transform $f(x)$ and $g(k)$ into each other, provided you have one.
