# 1. Origins of Quantum Theory; UV Catastrophe
This note explains the origins of Quantum theory, blackbody radiation and includes derivations of Rayleigh-Jeans and Maxwell-Planck laws.

## Origins of Quantum Theory

There are a few successes of classical physics, namely

- Newtonian Mechanics

- Maxwellian Electromagnetism

- Boltzmann Statistical Mechanics

But, there are 2 catastrophic breakdowns when applied to black body radiation and atomic spectra.

Let's first discuss some historical events leading up to the origins of quantum theory

- 1792: Wedgward remarks that all objects heated to the same temperature grow the same color.

- 1800s: Improvements in spectroscopy show that solids emit continuous spectra; gases emit discrete lines

- 1859: Kirchoff proposes model of thermal radiation emission to be a function of wavelength and temperature

$$
R(\lambda, T) \qquad \text{emissive power per unit area}
$$

## Blackbodies
Blackbodies are objects that absorb all incident EM waves, regardless of frequencies and incident angles, and they also emit radiations with a spectrum determined by its temperature. They are called such because light will not be reflected directly. Instead, incident light has the change to reach thermal equilibrium with the blackbody.

In other words, it is a cavity where light bounces many times off the walls. They are

- Perfect absorbers/Perfect emitters

- Equilibrium established between walls at temperature $T$ and light field

Classical Observations of Blackbodies include

- Stefan's Law (1879), which experimentally found that total radiation emitted from a glowing solid is proportional to $T^4$.

$$
R(T) = \int_{0}^{\infty} R(\lambda, T)d\lambda = \sigma T^4, \qquad \text{where }\sigma = 5.67\times 10^{-8} \frac{W}{m^2K^4}
$$


- Wien's Law: From spectroscopic data, found $\lambda_{max}T = 2.898\times10^{-3}mK$

## Rayleigh-Jeans Law
This law attempts to fit a functional form to the end part of the spectrum graph of $R$ vs. $\lambda$. 

## Derivation of Classical and Quantum Blackbody Radiation Formulae

#### Cavity of Standing Waves
Let's start with a simple object: a cube with sidelength $L$. The wave equation states

$$
\nabla^2\Psi(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2t}\Psi(\vec{r}, t)
$$

where $\Psi$ is a function that describes wave amplitude. Since we have a PDE, we can specify a boundary condition, where $\Psi = 0$ at the cavity walls, i.e.

$$
\Psi(x=0, y, z, t) = \Psi(x = L, y, z, t) = \cdots = 0
$$

The solution is known:

$$
\Psi(\vec{r}, t) = A(t) \sin(k_xx) \sin(k_yy)\sin(k_zz)
$$

and the boundary conditions require 

$$
k_i = \frac{n_i\pi}{L}, \qquad i = x, y, z; \text{and n is an integer}
$$

Notice the form of the solution. It is in a standing wave form, with a time varying amplitude

$$
A(t)B(x, y, z)
$$

this is what we will substitute into the wave equation. 

$$
-(n_1^2 + n_2^2 + n_3^3) \frac{\pi^2}{L^3} A(t) B(x, y, z) = \frac{1}{c^2}B(x, y, z)\frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2t}A(t)
$$

We will guess the form for $A(t)$ to be $A_0\cos(\omega t) + \phi$, where $\omega^2 = \frac{c^2\pi^2}{L}(n_1^2 + n_2^2 + n_3^2)$. 

Now, we need to count how many different ways (called modes) a given $\omega$ can be distributed over $n_i$. 

Let $g(\omega) = \frac{dN(\omega)}{d\omega}$, where $g$ is the number of modes per unit frequency. Thus

$$
N(\omega) = \int_{0}^{\omega}g(\omega)d\omega
$$

For a given $\omega$, the possible values of $n_i$ are bound and must obey

$$
n_1^2 + n_2^2 + n_3^2 \leq \frac{\omega^2L^2}{c^2\pi^2}
$$

Isn't this just a sphere of radius $\frac{\omega L}{c\pi}$?

Therefore, let's just consider one quadrant of the whole sphere and count that much of it

$$
N(\omega) = \frac{1}{8}\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi\frac{\omega^3L^3}{c^3\pi^3}\right) = \frac{\omega^3V}{6c^3\pi^2}
$$

where $V$ is the volume. Now let's convert to linear frequency using $\omega = 2\pi f$.

$$
N(f) = \frac{8\pi^3f^3V}{6c^3 \pi^2}
$$

$$
g(f) = \frac{dN(f)}{df} = \frac{4\pi f^2 V}{c^3}
$$

And since each mode has 2 polarization directions, we double it

$$
g(f) = \frac{8\pi f^2}{c^3} V
$$
