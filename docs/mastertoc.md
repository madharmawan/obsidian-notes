### Brief Blurb on These Notes

I have decided to compile all my notes here, aimed towards possibly helping future students who are taking the class in understanding the material. However, it is mainly a place for me to try and explain concepts in my own words, so the tone and style will be very conversational. Maybe that is a good thing. Some of the notes results directly from taking the class. Other notes come from combined knowledge of subjects, and trying to put it somewhere (mostly the math and physics subjects will be that). Some notes are a result of being a part of course staff or mentoring for the course (such as CS 61A, CS 61C). Other notes are notes I take for the class (such as the physics classes). Obviously, the notes meant for teaching will be done in a more student focused way and comprehensive, and the notes for learning can be a bit broken and segmented, so take these ideas into consideration. 

Notes I'm Planning on making into teaching notes in order of when I am planning on doing them.
CS 61A (Work in Progress)
CS 61C (Work in Progress)
EECS 16A/Math 54 (Planned)
CS 61B (Planned)
